# Arduino Self-Balancing Two-Wheel Robot

This project implements a self-balancing two-wheel robot using Arduino, a PID controller, and an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor.

## Description

The aim of this project is to create a robot that can balance itself on two wheels using feedback from the MPU6050 sensor and control algorithms implemented with Arduino. The robot adjusts the speeds of its motors to maintain its balance, making it capable of remaining upright even when subjected to external disturbances.

## Features

- Self-balancing mechanism using PID control
- Real-time orientation measurement with MPU6050 sensor
- Adjustable PID parameters for tuning performance
- Basic error handling and filtering for sensor data

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor
- Two DC motors with wheels
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N)
- Chassis, frame, and other mechanical components
- Power supply (e.g., batteries)

## Usage

1. Connect the MPU6050 sensor and motors to the Arduino board according to the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the board.
3. Power on the robot and observe its behavior.
4. Adjust PID parameters as needed to optimize performance.
5. Enjoy your self-balancing two-wheel robot!
